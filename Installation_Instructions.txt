Installation Instructions:

  1) Open a command line terminal and run the following command

        $ pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn anytree matplotlib

  2) Download this code repository though clicking the download button in the
     upper right corner.

  3) Go to the downloaded folder and rename it "Time_Series_Transformation_Tree"

  4) Move the "Time_Series_Transformation_Tree" folder into the directory that
     your project code is going to be created in.

  5) At the top of the python file that you want to use a TS_Tree in,
     import everything from tree.py with the relative path to wherever
     you moved the "Time_Series_Transformation_Tree" folder.

        Some possible examples:

            from tree import *

            from Time_Series_Transformation_Tree/tree import *

  6) Check out the SRS.pdf for extensive documentation on specific Use Case
     functionality.
